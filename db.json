Its old name was Bayalnad – land of the paddy fields – but it would come to be known as Wayanad.Its resources attracted outsiders – traders, colonialists, migrants from the lowlands, and eventually, the timber and tourist industries. Exploitation of the forest led to the exploitation and enslavement of its people, and as the forest dwindled, so did the Adivasis’ culture, their way of life, even their language. But these were not changes quietly and willingly accepted; Wayanad became a key centre of direct action and uprising, and a stronghold for the Naxalite movement.Spanning the time between the 1970s and the present, Valli is a tale of four generations who made this land their home. It is told through a diary that Susan – the daughter of two teachers, Thommichan and Sara, who eloped to Wayanad so that they could live together – leaves for her own daughter, Tessa.And in telling their story, Valli tells us stories of the land and its people, of interdependence and abuse, repression and resistance, despair and contentment – stories as vast and magical as the forest itself once was.",

Fresh after capturing Tololing Hill, the Unit was high on josh, but also battered and bruised.Braving the inhospitable terrain, freezing cold weather and facing fierce enemy fire, he was the first in this Ghatak Platoon to reach the top. Even after his body was pierced by multiple bullets and grenade shrapnel, he charged the enemy bunkers and cleared the path for the regiment to capture the mighty peaks of Tiger Hill.He displayed the most conspicuous courage, indomitable gallantry, grit and determination under extreme adverse circumstances during the Kargil War which made him the youngest awardee of the highest Indian military award – the Param Vir Chakra.The Hero of Tiger Hill is the true story of a brave soldier who leaves no stone unturned and fights valiantly for the honour of his country. In his own words, Captain (Hony) Yogendra Singh Yadav gives us an inspiring account of the Kargil War through his transformative journey of fulfilling his most cherished dream of serving the Indian Army.",

But do we really know what happiness is?Most of the existing literature paints a fuzzy picture of happiness, beautiful in words but lacking in practicality. In this book, Acharya Prashant shatters all misconceptions about happiness jargons like 'loving unconditionally' and 'living in the present'. He explains how what we commonly understand as happiness exists only in the backdrop of sadness, and what man is really looking for is not just happiness, but Ananda - an unconditional joy free from both happiness and sadness. Discarding multiple myths that burden our consciousness, the book draws from scriptures like the Gita and the Upanishads, revealing the true meaning of Ananda.If you have the courage to question your deep-rooted beliefs and enter an unfathomable territory beyond the duality of happiness and sadness, this book is for you.",

He was undefeated in all subsequent elections and became the state’s longest serving chief minister. While Modi strode Gujarat like a colossus, propelling multi-dimensional progress, bigger responsibilities beckoned. Modi’s exemplary success in Gujarat, paved the way for him to be popularly elected India’s prime minister in an overwhelming victory in 2014. He is a prime minister unlike anyone earlier, both in terms of appeal and body of work. As a result, in 2019, he was re-elected with an even bigger mandate.His appeal is the result of his work in many domains over a long social, political and administrative career. Modi’s impact is not restricted to India alone, and numerous national and international polls regularly declare that he is the most popular international leader.In 2021, Modi completed twenty continuous years as the head of a government. This book, a compilation of chapters authored by eminent intellectuals and domain experts, attempts a definitive and expansive exploration into the fundamental transformation of Gujarat and India over the last twenty years due to Modi’s unique model of governance.",

She traces the theme of translation in Antonio Gramsci’s Prison Notebooks and takes up the question of Italo Calvino’s popularity as a translated author. Lahiri considers the unique challenge of translating her own work from Italian to English, the question “Why Italian?,” and the singular pleasures of translating contemporary and ancient writers.Featuring essays originally written in Italian and published in English for the first time, as well as essays written in English, Translating Myself and Others brings together Lahiri’s most lyrical and eloquently observed meditations on the translator’s art as a sublime act of both linguistic and personal metamorphosis.",

For far too long, Indian women have been conditioned to believe that pregnancy and motherhood mark the end of their independent lives. Being a mother once meant bidding adieu to your fitness, beauty, career and individuality. But not anymore. In her debut memoir, celebrated officer of the Indian Administrative Service and the mother of two feisty little princesses, Durga Shakti Nagpal provides you with a detailed blueprint for a perfect pregnancy. She will ensure that the initiation of your life as a mother will be carried out with the focus and precision of a drill sergeant, while maintaining the relatability of the regular Indian mother-to-be. Durga Shakti will take you through a major life glow-up in those special nine months of your life, transforming you into the strongest, most accomplished version of yourself. From pregnancy friendly fitness and skincare, to healthy eating habits, meditation and skyrocketing your energy levels, she has it all covered. And not just that, Durga Shakti addresses several life issues that invariably accompany motherhood, but which are seldom addressed. Subjects like post-partum blues, pregnancy-related myths and beliefs, the role of an older child and the family’s active involvement during and after pregnancy are all beautifully dealt with. A highly accomplished bureaucrat by profession, and a mother and family woman by choice, Durga Shakti will help you find you the keys to striking a perfect balance between motherhood and life as a whole. This is every woman’s guide to carving out an extraordinary motherhood for herself, her child and her family.",

      "desc": "Oral historian Aanchal Malhotra's first book, Remnants of a Separation, was published in 2017 to mark the seventieth anniversary of India's Partition. It told a human history of the monumental event by exhuming the stories lying latent in ordinary objects that survivors had carried with them across the newly made border. It was acclaimed for the freshness of its approach to a decades-old, much-written-about subject. But more significantly, it inspired conversations within families: between the generation that had witnessed Partition and those who had only inherited its memories.In the Language of Remembering, as a natural progression, explores that very notion as it reveals how Partition is not yet an event of the past and its legacy is threaded into the daily lives of subsequent generations. Bringing together conversations recorded over many years with generations of Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and their respective diaspora, it looks at how Partition memory is preserved and bequeathed, its consequences disseminated and manifested within family, community and nation. With the oldest interviewees in their nineties and the youngest just teenagers, the voices in this living archive intimately and sincerely answer questions such as: Is Partition relevant? Should we still talk about it? Does it define our relationships? Does it build our characteristics or augment our fears, without us even realizing?As the subcontinent marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of Partition, In the Language of Remembering will most importantly serve as a reminder of the price this land once paid for not guarding against communal strife - and what could happen once again should we ever choose division over inclusion.",

How can we prevent a new pandemic from killing millions of people and devastating the global economy? Can we even hope to accomplish this? Bill Gates believes the answer is yes, and in this book he lays out clearly and convincingly what the world should have learned from COVID-19 and what all of us can do to ward off another disaster like it. Relying on the shared knowledge of the world's foremost experts and on his own experience of combating fatal diseases through the Gates Foundation, he first makes us understand the science of corona diseases. Then he helps us understand how the nations of the world, working in conjunction with one another and with the private sector, can not only ward off another COVID-like catastrophe but also go far to eliminate all respiratory diseases, including the flu. Here is a clarion call - strong, comprehensive, and of the gravest importance - from one of our greatest and most effective thinkers and activists.",
